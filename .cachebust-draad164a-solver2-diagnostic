DRAAD 164A - Solver2 Deployment Failure Analysis

Date: 2025-12-12T15:56:00Z
Issue: Railway deployment of Solver2 failed with 'Container failed to start'

Status: BUILD SUCCESS - Runtime Failure
  - ✅ Docker build completed (4.38 seconds)
  - ❌ Container startup crashed silently  
  - ❌ No error output in Railway logs

Root Cause Analysis:
1. Dockerfile & requirements.txt are CORRECT
2. main.py, models.py verified
3. Most likely: solver_engine.py import failure during startup
4. OR-Tools wheel compatibility with Python 3.12.7

Solution Strategy:
1. Add verbose startup logging to detect import errors
2. Verify solver_engine.py imports complete
3. Test OR-Tools installation in container
4. Add healthcheck that runs before uvicorn
5. Force Railway rebuild with cache-bust

Status: IN PROGRESS
