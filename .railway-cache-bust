# Cache-bust trigger for Railway deployment
# DRAAD 342: AFL Team Fixes (Prioriteit 1, 2 en 3)
# Timestamp: 2025-12-23T08:31:45Z
# Nonce: DRAAD-342-TEAM-FIX

This file is updated to force Railway to rebuild and redeploy.
The timestamp and nonce ensure a fresh build of the entire Next.js application.

Fixes implemented:
1. ✅ TypeScript interface: WorkbestandPlanning.team? property added
2. ✅ Solve-engine cleanup: extractTeamFromEmployeeId uses ONLY workbestand_capaciteit.team
3. ✅ Dataflow verification: Query 3 includes team field, buildCapaciteit maps it correctly

Expected result:
- Build passes without TypeScript errors
- AFL solve-engine correctly resolves team information
- Complete dataflow from Supabase -> workbenches -> solve logic
