FASE 5: Fix eslint-config-next Version Mismatch - Production Execution

Timestamp: 2025-12-16T23:13:11Z
Nonce: 3847
Action: Force Railway rebuild and npm ci refresh

Changes Applied:
================
✅ package.json: eslint-config-next 14.2.5 → 14.2.35
✅ package-lock.json: Root devDependencies synced
✅ .github/workflows/sync-dependencies.yml: Auto-sync workflow added
✅ cache-buster-fase5.json: Cache invalidation marker

Root Cause Fixed:
=================
next@^14.2.35 was incompatible with eslint-config-next@14.2.5
  → npm ci failed with 200+ missing package errors
  → Production build failed

Solution:
=========
Both versions now pinned to 14.2.35
  → npm ci can now resolve all dependencies
  → Production build should succeed
  → Railway auto-rebuild triggered on GitHub push

Expected Outcome:
=================
✅ Railway: New deploy triggered
✅ Build: npm ci completes without errors
✅ Build: next build succeeds
✅ Container: Starts on railway.app domain
✅ Status: Active and running

Build Parameters:
Node: >=20.0.0
npm: >=10.0.0
Next.js: 14.2.35 (with latest CLI)
ESLint Config: 14.2.35 (SYNCED)
