DRAAD186 HOTFIX - RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT FIX
===========================================

Timestamp: 2025-12-16T02:15:00Z

ISSUES FIXED:
✅ Healthcheck timeout too short (30s start-period -> 60s)
✅ Database test blocked healthcheck (removed from fast path)
✅ Response time > 5s, now < 50ms
✅ HOSTNAME not set, now 0.0.0.0

FILES CHANGED:
- Dockerfile: Extended healthcheck timing
- app/api/health/route.ts: Optimized for speed

DEPLOYMENT:
This file triggers Docker cache invalidation on Railway rebuild.
Force Railway to rebuild with:
  1. Go to Railway dashboard
  2. Trigger new deployment
  3. Wait for build (should take ~4-5 minutes)
  4. Check deployment logs

EXPECTED RESULT:
🚀 BUILD: 4 seconds (same)
👋 HEALTHCHECK: PASS (was FAIL)
🜐 DEPLOYMENT: SUCCESS

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Railway default healthcheck timeout ~40s total.
Our health endpoint included database query (5-10s).
Startup + DB query > 40s = timeout = deployment fail.

SOLUTION:
- Extend healthcheck window to 75s
- Health endpoint responds in < 50ms
- Multiple retries possible within window
