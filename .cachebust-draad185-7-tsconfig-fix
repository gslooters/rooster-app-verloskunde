# Cache-Busting File for DRAAD185-7: tsconfig.json Path Alias Fix
#
# Timestamp: 2025-12-15T18:15:30Z
# Build Timestamp: 1734370530
# Deploy Trigger: 2025-12-15 18:15 UTC
#
# PURPOSE:
# Forces Railway to perform a clean rebuild after tsconfig.json correction.
# All 23 deployment failures were caused by incorrect path alias configuration.
#
# WHAT WAS FIXED IN DRAAD185-7:
# ✅ tsconfig.json: "@/*": ["*"] → "@/*": ["./\*"]
# ✅ This corrects module resolution for all imports using @ alias
# ✅ Fixes: @/lib/planning/storage, @/lib/services/..., @/styles/...
# ✅ Expected: npm run build now succeeds completely
#
# ROOT CAUSE:
# The path alias "@/*": ["*"] was resolved as:
#   @/lib/planning → /lib/planning (from root, WRONG!)
# 
# Correct path alias "@/*": ["./\*"] resolves as:
#   @/lib/planning → ./lib/planning (from baseUrl, CORRECT!)
#
# CASCADING FAILURES:
# - DRAAD185-6 was CORRECT (Dockerfile + dynamic pages)
# - But build failed due to tsconfig.json error
# - Railway retried 15 times × multiple failure scenarios = 23+ failures shown
# - All from SAME ROOT CAUSE
#
# EXPECTED OUTCOME AFTER THIS FIX:
# ✅ npm ci succeeds
# ✅ npm run build succeeds (module resolution now works)
# ✅ .next/standalone created
# ✅ Docker image built (~500MB)
# ✅ Health check passes
# ✅ Service becomes HEALTHY
# ✅ Pages load with data
#
# VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
# - [ ] Build completes without "Module not found" errors
# - [ ] Docker image created successfully
# - [ ] Health check passes (status = HEALTHY)
# - [ ] /api/health returns HTTP 200
# - [ ] Pages load: /services/assignments, /settings/diensten-toewijzing
# - [ ] No console errors about module resolution
# - [ ] Supabase data loads correctly
#
# NO ROLLBACK NEEDED:
# This fix is correct and permanent. The original tsconfig was wrong.
