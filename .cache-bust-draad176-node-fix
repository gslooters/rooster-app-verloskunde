# DRAAD176: Node Resolution Fix - Cache Bust
# Date: 2025-12-14T15:00:00Z
# Issue: Railway Railpack failed to resolve 'node-20' from invalid nixpacks line
# Fix: Removed 'nixpacks = "node-20"' from railway.toml
# Result: Auto-detection now works, Railway detects Node >=20.0.0 from package.json
#
# Force rebuild with: npm ci && npm run build
# Deploy with: HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 PORT=$PORT node .next/standalone/server.js
#
# Expected outcome: Successful build and deployment
# Timestamp: 1734283800
