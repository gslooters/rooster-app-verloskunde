Last updated: 2025-11-21T18:48:00Z
Build ID: 73529841
Reason: CRITICAL - Removed max-w-[1400px] container blocking fullwidth table

🔥 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
- page.tsx had max-w-[1400px] mx-auto wrapper
- This blocked table from reaching fullwidth
- Child component fixes were ineffective because parent limited width

FIX APPLIED:
- Removed max-w container
- Removed bg-white wrapper
- Table now gets w-full (100% viewport width)

STATUS: Critical production fix
DEPLOY: IMMEDIATE
