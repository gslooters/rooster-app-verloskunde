DRAD-214-CORRECTED: Nested GREEDY Response Extraction Fix
Deploy Timestamp: 2025-12-19T21:26:47Z
Trigger ID: rt-1766187998600-4521
Priority: 🔴 CRITICAL

🎯 What's Fixed:
- Root cause: Code checked greedyData.status (undefined), real data at greedyData.solver_result.status
- Solution: Extract solver_result first, validate at correct nesting level
- Result: HTTP 200 responses now parsed correctly instead of cascading to error handler

📋 Deployment Actions:
1. Build frontend with new route.ts
2. Update Next.js API endpoint
3. Clear CDN cache
4. Smoke test /api/roster/solve endpoint

✅ Verification:
- GREEDY HTTP 200 → solver_result extracted correctly
- Response includes full solver_result object
- No more fake "GREEDY service error" for successful requests
- Frontend receives data and renders rooster

Do NOT deploy older versions of this file.
This fix is production-ready.
