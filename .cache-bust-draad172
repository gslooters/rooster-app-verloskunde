# DRAAD172 INTEGRATION Cache-Bust Root Marker
# Generated: 2025-12-13T09:35:12Z
# Status: INTEGRATION COMPLETE + READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
#
# === NEW INTEGRATION CHANGES (vs previous v2.0) ===
# COMMIT 1: accf4f0409d7... - Create solver_selector.py
#   - NEW SolverSelector class with strategy selection logic
#   - Supports both DRAAD172 (sequential greedy) and DRAAD170 (CP-SAT)
#   - Environment variable override: SOLVER_STRATEGY
#   - Automatic fallback CP-SAT on errors
#
# COMMIT 2: 5a937d5732b3... - Integrate into main.py
#   - Import SolverSelector (with safe fallback if unavailable)
#   - Update solve endpoints to use selector
#   - Add DRAAD172 to version/capabilities endpoints
#   - Enhanced logging for strategy selection
#
# COMMIT 3: 61cc3b2d445a... - DRAAD172-specific cache-bust
#   - New marker file: .cache-bust-draad172-integration
#   - Tracks integration commits separately
#
# === DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST ===
# [x] solver_selector.py created + committed
# [x] main.py updated with selector integration
# [x] Cache-bust files created
# [x] Root cache-bust marker updated (THIS FILE)
# [ ] Railway deployment triggered (NEXT STEP)
# [ ] Production rooster verification
#
# === FEATURE TOGGLES ===
# Environment: SOLVER_STRATEGY
#   Default: 'draad170' (CP-SAT - current production)
#   Option 1: 'draad172' (Sequential Greedy - new)  
#   Option 2: 'sequential' (alias for draad172)
#   Option 3: 'greedy' (alias for draad172)
#
# === BEHAVIORAL CHANGES ===
# 1. If SOLVER_STRATEGY not set: uses CP-SAT (DRAAD170) - NO CHANGE to current behavior
# 2. If SOLVER_STRATEGY=draad172: uses Sequential Greedy (DRAAD172)
# 3. If DRAAD172 fails: automatically falls back to CP-SAT
# 4. All responses use unified SolveResponse format - NO API changes
#
# === BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY ===
# - NO changes to SolveRequest/SolveResponse formats
# - NO changes to database schema
# - NO changes to API endpoints
# - Safe import fallback if selector module missing
# - Automatic fallback to CP-SAT on any error
#
# === TECHNICAL NOTES ===
# - Selector uses ThreadPoolExecutor for async-safe execution
# - Both solvers return unified SolveResponse
# - Logging shows which strategy was selected
# - Metadata field tracks solver used
#
# === NEXT DEPLOYMENT STEPS ===
# 1. Push commits to GitHub (DONE)
# 2. Cache-bust triggers Railway rebuild (THIS FILE)
# 3. Monitor Railway logs for startup
# 4. Test rooster on production
# 5. If DRAAD172 selected: verify sequential greedy works
# 6. If errors: automatic fallback to CP-SAT keeps service running
