Commit: d7cea82f0466fc5dd7d69adde7af37f10e18c47b

FIXES:
1. lib/supabase.ts - Removed placeholder fallback URLs
2. .env.local - Added proper environment variable instructions
3. Force Railway rebuild with correct NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
✅ Supabase URL resolves to: https://rzecogncpkjfytebfkni.supabase.co
✅ No more "placeholder.supabase.co" errors
✅ Rooster creation (Wizard) will work properly
✅ All database operations functional
