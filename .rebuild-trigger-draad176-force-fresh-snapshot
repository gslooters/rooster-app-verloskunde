# DRAAD176 AAA - FORCE FRESH SNAPSHOT REBUILD
# Issue: Railway Railpack using STALE snapshot from BEFORE railway.toml fix
# Action: Create new file to force Railway to discard cache and build fresh
# 
# SNAPSHOT ISSUE:
# - Railway log shows: sha256:39ad8b0ae3342c33a5ea4274... (STALE)
# - This snapshot predates our railway.toml fix commits
# - Railpack must discard this and fetch fresh source
#
# FORCE FRESH BUILD:
# - This file triggers new git commits
# - Railway sees new HEAD SHA
# - Forces snapshot refresh
# - Pulls fresh railway.toml (WITHOUT nixpacks line)
# - Build detects Node from package.json engines
# - Build succeeds!
#
# TIMESTAMP: 2025-12-14T16:03:00Z
# TRIGGER: Force Railway to use fresh snapshot
# EXPECTED: Successful build with Node 20.x auto-detection
