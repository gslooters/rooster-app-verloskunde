DRAAD166-FIX: PUT endpoint cache-busting headers

Problem:
- PUT /api/diensten-aanpassen saved data but didn't invalidate caches
- Modal continued showing stale data even after edits
- User refreshed button 3x, data still old

Root Cause:
- GET /api/planinformatie-periode had cache-busting headers
- PUT /api/diensten-aanpassen had NO headers
- When user edited Diensten and clicked Vernieuwen, Modal API call still got cached response

Solution:
- Added same aggressive cache headers to PUT response
- Now PUT invalidates all caches (browser, proxy, CDN)
- Modal refreshes get fresh data from database

Result:
- Edit Diensten (GRB 1→10) → PUT saves
- PUT response includes cache-busting headers
- Click Vernieuwen → GET calls fresh API
- Modal shows NEW data (10) ✓
