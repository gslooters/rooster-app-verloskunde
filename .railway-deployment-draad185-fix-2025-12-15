🔧 DRAAD185 ROOT CAUSE FIX - Lazy-load Supabase
================================================

Timestamp: 2025-12-15T18:57:53Z

Problem:
- Next.js tried to statically pre-render pages that import Supabase client
- Supabase client load requires NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL env var
- Build-time env vars were missing → ERROR: "supabaseUrl is required"

Solution:
- Changed both pages to lazy-import Supabase (dynamic import)
- Supabase modules only load when needed (client-side)
- Pages marked as `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
- Next.js no longer attempts static generation → no build errors

Fixes:
1. app/services/assignments/page.tsx - Lazy-load Supabase
2. app/settings/diensten-toewijzing/page.tsx - Lazy-load Supabase
3. Single-stage Dockerfile kept (simple, correct)
4. railway.toml kept (simple, correct)

Expected Railway Deployment:
✅ Build succeeds (no "supabaseUrl" errors)
✅ Frontend loads correctly
✅ Pages render dynamically with real env vars
✅ No static pre-rendering attempted

Railway: Force clean rebuild with cache invalidation
