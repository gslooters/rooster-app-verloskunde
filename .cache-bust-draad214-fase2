## Branch: DRAAD-214-fase2-improvements
## Status: FASE 2 Implementation Complete

This file triggers a clean rebuild on Railway for the greedy-service.

## Deployed Components:

- ✅ greedy_solver_v2.py - GreedySolverV2 algorithm
- ✅ constraint_validator.py - Constraint validation system
- ✅ solver_api.py - FastAPI integration
- ✅ requirements.txt - Updated dependencies
- ✅ Dockerfile - Multi-stage build configuration
- ✅ test_fase2.py - Comprehensive test suite

## Quality Assurance:

- ✅ Syntax validation passed
- ✅ Type hints verified
- ✅ Error handling checked
- ✅ Logging configured
- ✅ Tests included
- ✅ Documentation complete

## Deployment Notes:

Railway will:
1. Detect Dockerfile
2. Build greedy-service container
3. Run health checks
4. Deploy to railway.app
5. Expose /health, /solve, /validate endpoints

## Service Coordination:

This service runs independently alongside:
- rooster-app (frontend)
- Solver2 (constraint-programming solver)

GREATER can now choose between greedy and CP-SAT solving strategies.
