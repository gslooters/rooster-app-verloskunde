# 🔥 KRITIEK: Force Railway to detect this as Next.js, NOT Python
# Railway was incorrectly detecting Python due to solver/ directory
# This configuration FORCES Node.js/Next.js deployment

[phases.setup]
# Use Node.js 20.x (matches package.json engines requirement)
nixPkgs = ['nodejs-20_x']

[phases.install]
# Install dependencies using npm ci (faster, more reliable than npm install)
cmds = ['npm ci']

[phases.build]
# Build Next.js application (creates .next/standalone)
cmds = ['npm run build']

[start]
# Start Next.js standalone server
# Uses the start command from package.json which includes HOSTNAME and PORT config
cmd = 'npm run start'
