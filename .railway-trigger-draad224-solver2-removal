# DRAAD-SOLVER2-REMOVAL DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER

Date: 2025-12-20 19:51 CET
Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
Version: 2.0.0-DRAAD224-SIMPLIFIED

## Summary

Solver2 (SequentialSolverV2) completely removed from codebase:
- 12 Solver2-specific Python files deleted
- 4 Solver2-specific test files deleted
- main.py simplified (direct RosterSolverV2 CP-SAT routing)
- All imports and references updated
- No breaking changes for frontend (already not using solver)

## Changes Made

### Deleted Files (12)
- solver/sequential_solver_v2.py
- solver/sequential_solver.py
- solver/requirement_queue.py
- solver/employee_availability.py
- solver/assignment_report.py
- solver/solver_selector.py
- solver/solver_patches_draad167.py
- solver/solver_patches_draad167_fase2.py
- solver/test_sequential_solver_v2.py
- solver/test_requirement_queue_priority.py
- solver/test_integration_db_solver.py
- solver/test_e2e_roster_workflow.py

### Updated Files (1)
- solver/main.py: Removed SequentialSolverV2/SolverSelector imports; simplified to direct RosterSolverV2 calls

## Architecture (Now)

FastAPI -> RosterSolverV2 (CP-SAT) -> Supabase

No fallback routing. Direct optimization only.

## Deployment

Railway will:
1. Pull latest main branch (14 commits: 12 deletes + 1 update + 1 summary)
2. Run: docker build solver/
3. Run: python solver/main.py
4. Verify: GET /health returns version 2.0.0-DRAAD224-SIMPLIFIED
5. Verify: POST /api/v1/solve-schedule endpoint works with CP-SAT only

## Expected Result

✓ Build succeeds (no import errors)
✓ Service starts (all imports valid)
✓ Database integration works (graceful degradation if offline)
✓ Solver endpoint functional (direct RosterSolverV2)
✓ No Solver2 references in logs

## Monitoring

Check Railway logs for:
- Successful Python package installation
- FastAPI startup messages
- No "SequentialSolverV2" or "sequential_solver_v2" errors
- Database connection status (may degrade gracefully)

Test endpoint:
POST https://rooster-app-verloskunde.up.railway.app/api/v1/solve-schedule

Expect: Direct CP-SAT solving (no Solver2 routing)
