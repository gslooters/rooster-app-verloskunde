  "status": "DRAAD-200 ULTIMATE FIX - Build #59+",
  "timestamp": "2025-12-17T18:09:10Z UTC",
  "root_cause": "canvas is native binding - requires Python + build tools in Alpine",
  "solution": "Add apk packages: python3, make, g++, cairo-dev, jpeg-dev, pango-dev, giflib-dev",
  "dockerfile_change": "RUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++ cairo-dev jpeg-dev pango-dev giflib-dev",
  "npm_method": "npm ci --prefer-offline --verbose",
  "package_lock": "REQUIRED (from working baseline)",
  "expected_flow": [
    "1. Alpine packages installed (Python, make, build tools)",
    "2. npm ci resolves all 350+ dependencies",
    "3. canvas installs successfully (pre-built or compiles with tools available)",
    "4. canvg resolved as pure JS (no native compilation)",
    "5. npm run build succeeds (Next.js compilation)",
    "6. Docker image builds",
    "7. All 3 services deploy GREEN"
  ],
  "services_rebuilding": [
    {"name": "rooster-app-verloskunde", "status": "pending"},
    {"name": "Solver2", "status": "pending"},
    {"name": "greedy", "status": "pending"}
  ],
  "confidence": "EXTREMELY HIGH",
  "reasoning": "Alpine + build tools = canvas can compile. npm ci + complete lock file = deterministic build"
}
