# Railway Dockerfile Deployment Trigger
# DRAAD102C: Force Dockerfile build - abandon Nixpacks

# Timestamp: 1733343006
# Random: q8m4k9p2x7n5
# Date: 2025-12-04T20:30:06Z

# Critical changes:
# - Dockerfile: Python 3.13.0-slim + Node 20-slim multi-stage
# - railway.toml: builder = "DOCKERFILE"
# - .dockerignore: Build optimization
# - .nixpacks.toml: DELETED (conflicting config)

# Expected outcome:
# ✅ Python 3.13.0 exact version
# ✅ pip always available in PATH
# ✅ OR-Tools 9.14.6206 installs successfully
# ✅ Next.js builds in stage 1
# ✅ FastAPI serves static frontend + backend APIs
# ✅ Health check on /health endpoint

# Build strategy:
# Stage 1: node:20-slim - Build Next.js static export
# Stage 2: python:3.13.0-slim - FastAPI runtime + serve Next.js

# This is deployment attempt #9
# Previous 8 failures: Nixpacks Python 3.11 selection
# Root cause: .nixpacks.toml ignored by Railway
# Solution: Direct Dockerfile control
