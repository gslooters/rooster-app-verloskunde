DRAAD118A: FINAL CACHE BUSTER - PHASE 1 & 2 COMPLETE
Timestamp: 2025-12-06T20:32:35Z
Random: 8956143721

✅ PHASE 1 BACKEND COMPLETE:
  - models.py: BottleneckAnalysis types
  - solver_engine.py: analyze_bottlenecks() method
  - Response: bottleneck_report field (INFEASIBLE only)

✅ PHASE 2 FRONTEND COMPLETE:
  - route.ts: Conditional status update (FEASIBLE vs INFEASIBLE)
  - lib/types/solver.ts: All BottleneckAnalysis TypeScript interfaces
  - Response handling: Two paths (FEASIBLE with summary, INFEASIBLE with report)

✅ TYPE SAFETY: Full end-to-end type coverage
  - Backend Pydantic models sync with Frontend TypeScript types
  - No type mismatches between Python and Next.js
  - SolveResponse correctly represents both FEASIBLE and INFEASIBLE outcomes

🚀 READY FOR PHASE 3 (SCREEN COMPONENTS):
  - BottleneckAnalysisScreen (display analysis when INFEASIBLE)
  - FeasibleSummaryScreen (confirm solution when FEASIBLE)
  - Modified planRooster handler in design page

Both services (Python solver + Next.js frontend) are NOW IN SYNC and ready for component development.

Deploy: Both Railway (solver service) and Netlify (frontend) should be rebuilt.
