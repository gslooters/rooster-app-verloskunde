DRAAD166-RAILWAY-TRIGGER

File Purpose: Trigger automatic Railway deployment
Timestamp: 1733880629000 (2025-12-10T21:10:32Z)

Changes deployed:
1. PUT /api/diensten-aanpassen: Added cache-busting headers
2. Same aggressive headers as GET endpoint
3. ETag invalidation: Date.now() on each PUT
4. Result: Modal gets fresh data after edits

Problem Fixed:
- Edit Diensten data
- Modal still shows old data on refresh
- User had to refresh page to see changes
- Now: Click Vernieuwen = fresh data immediately

Root Cause:
- PUT had no cache headers
- GET had cache headers but couldn't bypass stale cache from PUT
- Now both endpoints coordinate cache invalidation

Status: Ready for deployment
