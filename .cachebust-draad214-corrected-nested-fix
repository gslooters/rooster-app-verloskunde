DRAAD-214-CORRECTED: Nested solver_result extraction fix
Timestamp: 2025-12-19T21:26:38Z
Fix ID: cb-1766187998547

Problem: Response parsing checked root level for status, real data was in solver_result
Solution: Extract solver_result first, validate at correct nesting level
Result: HTTP 200 responses now parsed correctly

Files updated:
- app/api/roster/solve/route.ts (nested extraction logic)

Deploy trigger: YES - Cache bust needed
