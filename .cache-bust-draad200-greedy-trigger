CACHE_BUST_DRAAD200_GREEDY
Timestamp: 1734650000000
Version: DRAAD200
Service: Greedy (Smart Allocation Engine)

Trigger Details:
  Build ID: DRAAD200_1734650000000_greedy
  Trigger Reason: Complete cache-bust with new timestamp strategy
  Railway Service: Greedy
  Expected Duration: 2-3 minutes
  
What's included:
  - DRAAD190 Smart Greedy algorithm (ACTIVE)
  - Two-level fairness sorting:
    * Primary: shifts_remaining ASC (least scheduled first)
    * Tie-breaker: shifts_in_run ASC (current run awareness)
  - Fast JavaScript scheduler
  - Real-time allocation monitoring
  - Coverage optimization (98%+ target)
  
Algorithm Verification:
  - Fair allocation: ENABLED
  - Constraint handling: All HC1-HC6 enforced
  - Solve time: 2-5 seconds typical
  - Coverage target: 95-99%
  - Load balancing: Optimized
  
Verification:
  - [ ] Build succeeds
  - [ ] DRAAD190 startup message appears in logs
  - [ ] Greedy endpoint responds
  - [ ] Health check passes
  - [ ] Fair allocation working
  - [ ] Coverage metrics healthy
