DRAAD173 RAILWAY REBUILD TRIGGER
Purpose: Trigger new Docker build after NameError fix
Timestamp: 2025-12-13T12:26:46Z
Random: 7382

Fixed Issue:
  - solver_selector.py: Corrected variable name case (Solver_STRATEGY_ENV → SOLVER_STRATEGY_ENV)
  - Docker build will now complete successfully
  - Container will start without NameError

Expected Outcome:
  ✅ Docker build succeeds
  ✅ All imports complete successfully
  ✅ Service starts and is ready for requests
  ✅ Both DRAAD170 (CP-SAT) and DRAAD172 (Sequential) solvers available

Deployment Status: READY FOR REBUILD
