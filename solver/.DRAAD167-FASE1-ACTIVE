[DRAAD167-FASE1] IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVE

Date: 2025-12-12T18:35:00Z
Status: EXECUTING
Commit: fc47a287d2854a363a324bc0b6ec77e7d5a7271e

FIX 1: Constraint 7 softening (80-110% tolerance)
FIX 2: Pre-solve validation (validate_feasibility_beforehand)

Impact:
- Prevents INFEASIBLE collapse from minor capacity gaps
- Detects obvious conflicts BEFORE solver runs
- Saves compute time and provides better diagnostics

Deployment: Auto to Railway on push
