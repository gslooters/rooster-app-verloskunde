# Date: 2025-12-06 15:34 UTC
# Commit: d574324f41b4324abc2607e27bfbd03fc04223d9
# 
# Changes:
# - Updated CORS allow_origins from ["*"] to specific domains
# - Now only rooster-app-verloskunde.up.railway.app can access solver
# - Added localhost for development
# - Restricted HTTP methods to GET, POST, OPTIONS
# - Restricted headers to Content-Type, Authorization
# 
# Impact:
# - Production security hardening
# - No breaking changes to rooster-app (already configured)
# - Solver2 redeploy triggered automatically
# - Cache-buster: 1733506442 (Date.now())

# Railway auto-detects changes and redeploys
# Monitor at: https://railway.app/project/90165889-1a50-4236-aefe-b1e1ae44dc7f
